        </td>
        <td>
            &#9785; In case of some software deliverables, especially the large ones, it is difficult to assess the effort required at the beginning of the software development life cycle.

    <tr>
        <td>
            &#9787; People and interactions are emphasized rather than process and tools. Customers, developers and testers constantly interact with each other.
        </td>
        <td>
            &#9785; There is lack of emphasis on necessary designing and documentation.

    <tr>
        <td>
            &#9787; Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months).
        </td>

            &#9785; The project can easily get taken off track if the customer representative is not clear what final outcome that they want.

            &#9785; Only senior programmers are capable of taking the kind of decisions required during the development process. Hence it has no place for newbie programmers, unless combined with experienced resources.
