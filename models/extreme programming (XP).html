        Extreme Programming (XP): Advantages and Disadvantages

        <tr>
            <td>
                &#9787; Continuous testing and refactoring practices help create stable well-performing systems with minimal debugging.
            </td>
            <td>
                &#9785; In many instances, the customer has no clear picture of the end result, which makes it almost unrealistic to accurately estimate scope, cost, and time.
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>
                &#9787; Simplicity value implies creating a clear, concise code that is easy to read and change in the future if needed.
            </td>
            <td>
                &#9785; Regular meetings with customers often take a great deal of time that could instead be spent on actual code writing.
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>
                &#9787; The minimalistic iterative approach to development ensures that the workable results can be delivered very soon and only necessary features are built.
            </td>
            <td>
                &#9785; Documentation can be scarce and lack clear requirements and specifications, leading to project scope creep.
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>
                &#9787; Documentation is reduced as bulky requirements documents are substituted by user stories.
            </td>
            <td>
                &#9785; The rapid transition from traditional methods of software development to extreme programming demands significant cultural and structural changes.
            </td>

        <tr>
            <td>
                &#9787; Constant communication provides a high level of visibility and accountability and allows all team members to keep up with the project progress.
            </td>
            <td>
                &#9785; Pair programming takes more time and doesnâ€™t always work right due to the human factor and character incompatibility.
